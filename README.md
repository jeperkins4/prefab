Prefab
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeperkins4/prefab.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeperkins4/prefab)

Prefab provides [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), jQuery Datatable, Spreadsheet, and Service class generators for Rails 5 (supported Rails >= 5.0.1). Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.

This gem is heavily inspired by [Bootstrap-generator](https://github.com/decioferreira/bootstrap-generators).  This gem began as a fork of his project, but then took on a life of its own.

## Current Twitter Bootstrap version

The current version of Twitter Bootstrap is 3.1.1.

## Installing Gem

In your Gemfile, add this line:

    gem 'prefab', '~> 1.0.2'

Or you can install from latest build:

    gem 'prefab', :git => 'git://github.com/jeperkins4/prefab.git'

Run bundle install:

    bundle install

## Generators

Get started:

    rails generate prefab:install -f

Once you've done that, any time you generate a controller or scaffold, you'll get [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) templates.

### Give it a try

    rails generate scaffold post title body:text published:boolean

You can easily customize colors, grid system, fonts, and much more by editing `bootstrap-variables.[less|scss]` on your application assets folder.

## Usage

To print the options and usage run the command `rails generate prefab:install --help`

    rails generate prefab:install [options]

    Options:
      -e, [--template-engine=TEMPLATE_ENGINE]       # Indicates when to generate template engine
                                                    # Default: erb
      -se, [--stylesheet-engine=STYLESHEET_ENGINE]  # Indicates when to generate stylesheet engine
                                                    # Default: scss

    Runtime options:
      -f, [--force]    # Overwrite files that already exist
      -p, [--pretend]  # Run but do not make any changes
      -q, [--quiet]    # Supress status output
      -s, [--skip]     # Skip files that already exist

    Copy BootstrapGenerators default files

### Options

#### Template engines

Supported template engines:

* Haml

##### Haml

Add the dependency on your Gemfile:

    gem 'haml-rails'

And then run:

    rails generate prefab:install --template-engine=haml


#### Stylesheet engines

Supported stylesheet engines:

* CSS
* SCSS

Make sure you have `sass-rails` dependency on your Gemfile:

    gem 'sass-rails'

And then run:

    rails generate prefab:install --stylesheet-engine=scss

Now you can customize the look and feel of Bootstrap.

## Assets

### Customize and extend Bootstrap

You will get an `app/assets/stylesheets/prefab-variables.[less|scss]` file with all of the default variables of Bootstrap. This way you can customize the look and feel of Bootstrap without having to download any extra file.

### Javascript

Select all jQuery plugins (`app/assets/javascripts/prefab.js`)

    //= require prefab

## Customizing Templates

In Rails 3.0 and above, generators donâ€™t just look in the source root for templates, they also search for templates in other paths. And one of them is lib/templates.

Since Bootstrap Generators installs its templates under lib/templates, you can go and customize them.
